## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- OpenMRS instance (or use included mock data)
- OpenAI API key (optional)
- Ollama installation (optional, for local AI processing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmesplana/openmrs_ai_insights.git
   cd openmrs_ai_insights
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. In a separate terminal, start the proxy server:
   ```bash
   npm run proxy
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Local Development Options

When running locally, the application offers two modes:

1. **Mock Data Mode** (default):
   - Uses built-in mock patient data instead of connecting to an OpenMRS server
   - No need to handle CORS issues during development
   - Just click "Connect" with any credentials to get started
   - Includes three sample patients for testing
   - Search for "Smith" or "Johnson" to find patients

2. **Local Proxy Mode**:
   - Toggle off the "Use mock data" switch in Settings to use this mode
   - Connects to the real OpenMRS API through a local proxy server
   - Requires running the proxy server in a separate terminal:
     ```bash
     npm run proxy
     ```
   - Requires valid OpenMRS credentials

## üí° Use Cases

### Clinical Decision Support
- Quick review of patient history, conditions, vitals, and trends
- Natural language querying for specific medical information
- Highlight potential issues or concerning values

### Medical Education
- Interactive learning with realistic patient scenarios
- Explore medical relationships and causations
- Practice clinical reasoning in a safe environment

### Research and Analysis
- Extract insights from complex patient data
- Identify patterns that may not be immediately apparent
- Generate summaries of patient history for case studies

### Administrative Efficiency
- Quickly gather information for reporting purposes
- Summarize relevant patient information for referrals
- Reduce time spent manually reviewing charts

## üîß Configuration

### Using OpenAI

1. Open the settings panel in the application
2. Select "OpenAI" as the AI provider
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Save settings

### Using Ollama (Local AI)

1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) on your local machine
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3` (or other model of your choice)
3. Start Ollama locally
4. In the application settings, select "Ollama (Local)" as the AI provider
5. Set the endpoint (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
6. Select your preferred model
7. Save settings

### Using Mock AI

- No configuration needed - this is the default when no API keys are provided
- Great for UI testing and development
- Can answer basic questions about the patient data

## üìà Key Problem Solved

OpenMRS AI Insights addresses several critical challenges in healthcare information systems:

1. **Information Overload**: Healthcare providers often struggle to quickly find relevant information in patient records. This tool allows natural language queries to extract only the needed information.

2. **Limited Accessibility**: Traditional EMR interfaces can be complex and difficult to navigate. A conversational interface makes patient data more accessible to all users.

3. **Privacy Concerns**: By offering Ollama integration for local AI processing, the tool provides advanced AI capabilities without sending sensitive patient data to external services.

4. **Integration Challenges**: The application's proxy server simplifies integration with existing OpenMRS installations, addressing common CORS and authentication issues.

5. **Resource Constraints**: In resource-limited settings, the ability to run locally and use mock data allows for training and demonstration without requiring constant internet connectivity or API usage costs.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- API keys are stored locally in the browser and never transmitted to third parties
- Ollama integration allows for completely local AI processing with no data sent to external services
- All API requests go through a local proxy to prevent exposing credentials
- No patient data is stored outside your local environment

## Usage

1. **Connect to OpenMRS**:
   - Enter your OpenMRS server URL, username, and password
   - Default values are provided for the demo server:
     - URL: https://o2.openmrs.org/openmrs
     - Username: admin
     - Password: Admin123
   - For local development, you can use mock data with any credentials

2. **Search for Patients**:
   - Enter a search term (at least 3 characters)
   - Select a patient from the results
   - For mock data mode, try searching for "Smith" or "Johnson"

3. **View Patient Data**:
   - Browse through the tabs to view different aspects of the patient's data
   - Expand/collapse sections to see more details

4. **Ask AI Questions**:
   - Configure your preferred AI provider in Settings
   - Type questions about the patient in the input field
   - View AI-generated responses based on the patient data

## Technology Stack

- React with Vite
- Chakra UI for styling
- Axios for API requests
- React Query for data fetching
- OpenAI API for cloud AI functionality
- Ollama for local AI processing
- Express local proxy server for development

## How CORS Issues Are Handled

This application handles CORS issues in several ways:

1. **For local development**: 
   - Default: Mock data mode that doesn't require API connections
   - Alternative: Local proxy server that forwards requests to OpenMRS API

2. **For production**:
   - Direct API connections (when deployed on domains allowed by the OpenMRS server)
   - Create serverless functions to proxy the requests (recommended for Vercel deployment)
   - Configure the OpenMRS server to allow CORS from your domain
